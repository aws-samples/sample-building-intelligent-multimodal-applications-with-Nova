    "# 🎆 Amazon Nova Omni - Image Editing Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Image editing is accomplished by passing a single image and a set of text instructions to the model. This example uses the Converse API. Image editing should allow you to do all of the following (and possibly more):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add elements\n",
    "* Remove elements\n",
    "* Replace elements\n",
    "* Change elements (e.g. “change his shirt to red”)\n",
    "* Change the background\n",
    "* Extract or isolate an item in an image\n",
    "* Modify action/pose without changing the subject's identity (e.g. “Make this person smile”, “Make the man look to the left”)\n",
    "* Change the position of an item (e.g. \"Move the apple to the left half of the image\")\n",
    "* Change an image’s style\n",
    "* Change the lighting in an image\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This hands-on section will guide you through how to use Nova Omni image editing capabilities with real-estate listing examples\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you'll have:\n",
    "- ✅ An understanding of how to edit images using Nova Omni\n",
    "- ✅ Examples to get you started\n",

    "1. Object Addition to image - Virtual staging of a home\n",
    "2. Object removal - Remove unwanted objects from images. Remove cars and garbage from image\n",
    "3. Replace objects - Replace older furniture with newer good looking furniture\n",
    "4. Adjust/Improve the image - Improve unkept lawn by making  green grass enhancements\n",
    "5. Relighting - Replace dull or overcast skies with bright blue ones to make the exterior look more inviting\n",
